# C/Bash-workshop
All those codes are based on different subjects given to students at the EPITA school.
Students have 2 weeks, Monday to Saturday (Sunday is rest-day ðŸ’¤), 8AM ðŸ•— to midnight ðŸ•› to complete all those exercises.

No subject can be published due EPITA copyrights but the given codes are free to read and use, it is a great repository to learn C language through different and mandatory notions.
It also contains some shell codes to learn basics of the bash functionalities.

## Disclaimer
If you're an EPITA student and plan to use some codes or some part of them, I cannot be charged for any cheat-flag that can be raised on you.
